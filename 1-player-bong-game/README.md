this is 1 player bong game with the wall - 

the background is white and the ball and the paddle are black -

you can move in any direction but can't go out of the screen -

the ball bounce off the walls and the top -

the ball respawns at the top when it hit the bottom -

the game has small glitch that if you are moving up fast the ball will pass you -

i used SDL2 library and C language -

Enjoy
